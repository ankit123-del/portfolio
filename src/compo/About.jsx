          Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Ankit Sharma</strong>, a passionate Full Stack Developer who loves building scalable and user-friendly applications...
          and I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in full-stack web development, with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
          <br /><br />
          I have completed multiple internships, including as a Frontend Developer Intern at Yatharth Educational Services, where I worked with React.js to enhance UI/UX and optimize performance, and as a Python Programming Intern at Mission Minded Foundation, where I developed automation scripts and improved my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
          <br /><br />
          Recently, I worked as a MERN Stack Developer Intern at UpFlair Pvt. Ltd., where I built full-stack applications, developed RESTful APIs, and integrated real-time features into live projects.
